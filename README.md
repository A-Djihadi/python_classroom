# 🐍 Python Projects & AI Experiments

Welcome to my public repository where I store all my Python learning projects and experiments related to Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
This repo is a space for exploration, practice, and growth — feel free to explore, use, and contribute!

## 📚 About

This repository contains small to medium-sized projects, scripts, and notebooks I’ve worked on to improve my Python skills and explore its applications, especially in:

- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- 🤖 Machine Learning (ML)
- 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization
- 🧪 Algorithmic Practice

Whether it's building basic tools, solving problems, or testing libraries, each folder contains self-contained projects with documentation and comments when needed.

## 🧱 Structure

The repository is organized by topic or type of project. 
I will try to make somthing organize with a README when it neccessary.
